== Theme Features ==

=== Read Me First section ===

* support
* review
* author page
* components

=== Widgets ===

Theme has only one widgets area in right sidebar

=== Menu ===

This theme uses wp_nav_menu() in nine locations.

* First location: top menu has only one level depth.

 Social media links converted to icons.

* Six locations in footer as footers mega menu.

=== Custom Excerpt Length section ===

By default the excerpt length is set to return 55 words. Now you can change it in Customizer by moving the slider. Available range is from 1 to 200 but you can set it precisely by input field below.

This functionality works only for posts with empty excerpt metabox (even if you used tag) and only with the_excerpt function, so it doesn't work for teaser when the_content() function is used.

Excerpt length filter is assigned to archive page as well.
